# RotationZoomer jQuery plugin

This plugin allows you to easily rotate and zoom images/canvas elements in simplistic fashion. It offers rotation in place without worrying about padding or margin. Elements can only be rotated by 90 degree angles.

Once you call the function on image or canvas element, that element becomes hidden and is instead replaced by canvas element where the actual manipulation occurs.

The source is written in CoffeeScript v. 1.11.0 and composed & minified using [coffeebar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/coffeebar). The images are by artist [Matthew Divito and are taken from his personal webpage](http://cargocollective.com/matthewdivito).

## Usage

The behaviour is as expected from any other jQuery plugin. This is the most simple configuration:

            $('#example1').rotationZoomer();

## Examples

Please see [Project page](https://comatory.github.io/rotation-zoomer/) for all configurations and examples on how to use this.
